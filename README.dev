The Makefile includes a command ('debrepo') to build a Packages.gz file and put
this into the apt/ directory in the branch gh-pages. gh-pages is a branch
treated specially by github. As soon as a commit is pushed, github will copy
the files and produce a webpage accessible via http://<github
user>.github.com/<project name>. We use this to build a simple apt repository
hosted on GitHub.

To update the apt repo, build the debian packages (using make builddeb in each
package), then run make debrepo in the project root. Commit and then push and
it should all work! :)
