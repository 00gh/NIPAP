This is a README file for developers. If you are not a developer, you'll likely
find this file rather boring.

The Makefile includes a command ('debrepo') to build a Packages.gz file and put
this into the apt/ directory in the branch gh-pages. gh-pages is a branch
treated specially by github. As soon as a commit is pushed, github will copy
the files and produce a webpage accessible via http://<github
user>.github.com/<project name>. We use this to build a simple apt repository
hosted on GitHub.

To update the apt repo, build the debian packages (using make builddeb in each
package), then run make debrepo in the project root. Commit and then push and
it should all work! :)

VERSIONING
==========
PyarrFS follows the pretty common version format of major.minor.patch. What
constitutes major and minor features is of course difficult to tell and as we
intend to release rather often we will likely end up with a minor version bump
for every feature. This could lead to something like the Linux kernel which
staid at 2.6 for pretty long before Linus bumped it to version 3.0 with no real
major changes, it was just the right time. I think that will work well for us
as well.

I don't believe in date-based (like Ubuntu) versioning as we release when
things are done, not according to some artificial deadline.
