Description: Automatically create user for web interface?
 The NIPAP backend daemon, nipapd, appears to be installed on this system.
 Would you like to add a user to the local auth database of nipapd for the web
 interface? The configuration file for the web interface will be updated with
 the new user so that the web interface becomes functional.
 .
 Creating a user will get you up and running with the web interface. If you
 answer No, you will need to manually create a user and configure the web
 interface with those credentials.
