 the new user so that the web interface becomes functional.

Description: The NIPAP web UI is now migrated to Python 3.
 Depending on how it is served, some further action might be needed for it to

 described in the installation guide, the Python 3 version of mod_wsgi needs to
 be installed:
 .
 apt install libapache2-mod-wsgi-py3
