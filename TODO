 - find_free_prefix needs to work :) both from-pool and from-prefix

 - add search_prefix, a more capable search / listing function for prefixes
   able to do non-equal based listing. should probably implement our wonderful
   "dict-sql"

 - improve add_prefix, currently "prefix" is required and means a prefix must
   be manually provided. "from-prefix" or "from-pool" could be provided instead
   and add_prefix would take from the specified pool or prefix instead.
    * from-prefix should be a list.
	* from-pool could maybe be a list, but does it really make sense? and what
	  happens with default_prefix_length if it's different for the different
	  pools specified?

 - find_free_prefix() should support a start address from where it should start
   searching for new candidate prefixes. prolly useful for paginating output in
   a potential web gui

 - add test suite for the XML-RPC API
