Installation of NIPAP
=====================
NIPAP is officially supported on Debian and Debian derivatives. This includes
pre-built packages, an automated installation (using Debians post-installation
script) and above all, that it is tested.

Installation
------------
If you are running a Debian system or a Debian derivative, see
install-debian.rst for installation instructions.

NIPAP should be able to run on any Unix-like operating system but you will need
to install dependencies and NIPAP manually. See install-unix.rst for
instructions.

Configuration
-------------
Once you have NIPAP installed on your machine, read config-nipapd.rst for a
configuration guide of the NIPAP backend (nipapd).

config-cli.rst covers configuration of the CLI while config-www.rst covers the
necessary configuration for setting up the NIPAP web UI.
