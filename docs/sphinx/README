NIPAP documentation
-------------------

The main NIPAP documentation is generated using the Sphinx
(http://sphinx.pocoo.org) document generator. To build everything, make sure
you have sphinx installed and run:

  make html

in the current directory to generate the HTML documentation. The generated
files are then placed in the _build/html/ directory.
