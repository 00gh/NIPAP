.. Nap documentation master file, created by

   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

====================

This is where the mail Nap documentation is located. The API documentation is
generated from the main Nap python module, which places som irrelevant
information about the classes on the same page. Don't let that scare you,
instead focus on the methods of the Nap class which all are published with the
same arguments as listed there.

Happy hacking!
