.. Nap documentation master file, created by

   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

====================

The Nap API documentation is generated from the server side Nap python module
and therefore contains some irrelevant information regarding internal class
structures. Don't let that scare you, instead focus on the methods of the Nap
class which all are available over XML-RPC with the same arguments as listed.

Happy hacking!
