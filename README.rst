NIPAP
=====
NIPAP is the Neat IP Address Planner - a system built for managing large amounts of IP addresses.

Features in short:
 * Very fast and scalable to hundred of thousands of prefixes
 * Native support for IPv6 (full feature parity with IPv4)
 * Support for VRFs through the use of "schemas", allowing overlapping prefixes
 * Rapid address assignment using automatic assignment from pre-defined address-pools
 * XML-RPC middleware, allowing easy integration
 * Easy to use (and pretty) web interface (in turn utilizing the XML-RPC interface)
 * Flexible authentication using SQLite and/or LDAP
